## Title : **Think like the Cardinality Estimator**
### Abstract
You migrate your on-premise SQL Database to cloud, taking advantage of the PaaS offering of Azure SQL Database. You heard the promise of spinning up databases on demand and being able to scale up resources during high peak and scale down when not in use. You also want to make sure you are performing integrity checks, index defragmentation, and statistics updates when necessary. There is no SQL Agent, so how do you automate your jobs? Do you have time to do this manually each time? No. There are different options available to automate these long-running, manual, error-prone, and frequently repeated tasks to increase reliability, efficiency.

In this demo intensive session, I will show you different options on how to automate these tasks. Some of these solutions use on-prem infrastructure and services in Azure, which are conveniently encapsulated within the collective Azure portal experience.

At the end of this session, you will have a solid understanding of how to automate SQL Server Maintenance tasks, including replacing SQL Agent functionality with multiple options.
