## Title : **New features in Management Studio â€” Performance Troubleshooting made easier!**
### Abstract
SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) is now updated each month with the latest version of the SQL Client Tools, which enabled rapid enhancement to the Execution Plan.
 
Do you know that now you can see how many pages are spilled to disk for a sort, as well as the memory statistics for sort operator? Are you aware that you can see the top 10 waits for single execution and what trace flags were active during compilation, including the scope of the trace flags? Have you ever analyzed a big plan and wish you could search for the table name, index name, or column name without opening the XML plan? When you see an index used, do you know for sure which statistics were used by the Query Optimizer to estimate the number of rows?
 
In this demo intensive session, I will show you how to find and use new features introduced into SSMS and Showplan. You will walk out of this session equipped to make Query Performance Troubleshooting easier, and ready to tackle those nasty, hard to solve query plans.
